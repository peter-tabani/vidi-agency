# The "Zip Code Tax"

Have you ever noticed that a "quote" for a website seems to change depending on where your business is located?

If you call an agency in **San Francisco**, they might quote you **$15,000** for a standard business site.
If you call an agency in **Des Moines**, that same site might be **$4,000**.

Why?

You aren't paying for better code. You are paying for their **office rent** and their **local cost of living**.

## The Global Advantage

In 2026, code is universal. A React website built in Nairobi works exactly the same as a React website built in New York. The only difference is the overhead cost of the agency building it.

At Vidi Agency, we believe in **Global Quality at Fair Prices**.

We strip away the expensive downtown office and the "Zip Code Tax." You pay for:
1.  **Senior-Level Developers:** Not interns.
2.  **Strategy & Consulting:** Real business advice.
3.  **Results:** A site that works.

You do **not** pay for our fancy espresso machine or Manhattan rent.

## When Local Matters (And When It Doesn't)

* **You NEED Local:** If you need a photographer to physically come to your office and take headshots.
* **You DON'T Need Local:** For coding, design, SEO, and strategy. Zoom and Slack have bridged that gap perfectly.

Don't pay extra just because your agency has a fancy address. Pay for the result.
