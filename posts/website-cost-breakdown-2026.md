# The "It Depends" Answer (Simplified)

One of the most frustrating things about looking for a web designer is that no one wants to give you a straight answer on price.

At Vidi Agency, we believe in transparency. In 2026, website pricing generally falls into three buckets. Here is exactly what you get in each tier, so you can decide what is right for your business.

## Tier 1: The DIY Route ($20 - $50/month)
* **Platforms:** Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy.
* **Best For:** Hobbyists, personal blogs, or businesses with zero budget.
* **The Reality:** You save money, but you pay with **time**. You will spend roughly 40-60 hours learning the tool, writing content, and fighting with the layout.
* **Hidden Cost:** These sites often struggle to rank on Google because the code is heavy and generic.

## Tier 2: The Freelancer / Offshore ($500 - $1,500)
* **Best For:** Startups needing a "digital business card."
* **The Reality:** You get a basic site, often built on a WordPress template.
* **The Risk:** Reliability. If the site breaks in six months, will that freelancer still be around to fix it?

## Tier 3: The Growth Agency ($2,500 - $8,000+)
* **Best For:** Established businesses that need their website to **generate leads**.
* **The Reality:** You aren't just paying for code; you are paying for strategy. This includes:
    * **Copywriting** that sells.
    * **SEO** setup to get you found.
    * **Speed Optimization** for mobile.
    * **Lead Capture** systems (CRM integration).

## Which One Do You Need?

If you just need to exist online, Tier 1 or 2 is fine.
If you need your website to **make money**, Tier 3 is an investment, not an expense.
