# The "Ghost Clinic" Problem

If you feel like you are constantly hiring, training, and then losing staff, you are not alone. In late 2024, **62% of dentists** cited staffing as their top challenge for the upcoming year.

The math is brutal: The cost to replace a single administrative staff member now hits **$70,000** when you factor in recruitment, training, and lost productivity.

But the real problem isn't that you can't find people. It's that your current people are drowning in "Ghost Work."

## What is Ghost Work?

Ghost Work is the manual, repetitive data entry that requires zero human empathy but 100% of your staff's time.

* Manually entering patient forms from a clipboard.
* Sitting on hold with Delta Dental to verify benefits.
* Calling patients 3 times to confirm appointments.

## The Solution: The "Training Tax" Reduction

You cannot afford to pay a human $25/hour to do work a script can do for $0.05.

At Vidi Agency, we implement **User-Friendly Automation Systems** that remove the "Training Tax." Instead of needing 6 months to train a new front desk coordinator on complex insurance codes, our software handles the logic.

**The Result:** Your new hires can focus on smiling at patients, not fighting with software. You can run a million-dollar practice with 30% fewer administrative staff, insulating you from the labor shortage.
