# The "Free Estimate" Trap

If you are a roofer, remodeler, or general contractor, you know the pain: You spend 45 minutes driving to a lead's house, spend an hour measuring and discussing options, only to hear:
*"Okay, we'll get back to you. We're looking for the cheapest option."*

You just wasted 3 hours and $50 in gas.

The problem isn't your pricing. The problem is your **filtering process**.

## Your Website Should Be Your Best Salesman

Most contractor websites are basically digital business cards. They list services and say "Call for a Quote." This invites everyone, including low-quality leads.

A **Vidi Conversion Site** acts as a filter.

### 1. Show Pricing Tiers Upfront
By displaying "Starting at" prices or "Good/Better/Best" packages, you immediately scare away the cheap leads. The people who call you *already know* your price range.

### 2. The Project Gallery "Trust Factor"
High-ticket clients (the ones paying $50k+ for a remodel) buy based on **trust**, not price.
* **Don't use:** Stock photos of perfect homes.
* **Do use:** "In-progress" and "Completed" photos with the location tagged (e.g., *"Kitchen Remodel in Frisco, TX"*). This proves you are local and legitimate.

## Automation Follow-Up

Speed leads to money. If a lead fills out a form on your site at 8 PM, do they wait until the next morning to hear from you?

With our automation systems:
1.  **Instant Text:** "Thanks for the inquiry, Mike. I'm reviewing your details. When is a good time for a 5-min call?"
2.  **Email Sequence:** Sends them a PDF of your "Recent Projects" to build hype.

Stop chasing bad leads. Let your system bring you the good ones.
