# So, You Want to Build It Yourself?

We respect the hustle. Many great businesses started with a founder building their own website late at night. If you have the time and an eye for design, it is entirely possible to launch your own site.

Here is the professional checklist we use at Vidi Agency. You can use this to build your own site today.

## Step 1: Secure Your Domain & Hosting
Don't just buy the cheapest hosting. Cheap hosting means a slow site, and Google hates slow sites. Look for "Managed WordPress Hosting" or cloud platforms like Vercel if you are tech-savvy.

## Step 2: Map Your "User Journey"
Before you touch a design tool, grab a pen and paper.
* What is the **#1 goal** of the site? (Calls? Emails? Sales?)
* How do we get the user from "Hello" to "Buy" in 3 clicks?

## Step 3: Write "You-Focused" Copy
Most DIY sites fail here. They write "We are great, We were founded in 1990."
**Fix it:** Write about the customer. "Here is how we solve **your** problem."

## Step 4: Mobile Optimization
Design your site on your phone first. 70% of your traffic will come from mobile. If buttons are too small to tap with a thumb, you will lose customers.

## Step 5: The "3-Second" Test
Show your site to a stranger for 3 seconds. Can they tell you **what you do** and **how to contact you**? If not, start over.

### **Feeling Overwhelmed?**

If reading that list made you tired, that is normal. Your expertise is running your business, not debugging mobile layouts.

If you want to skip the learning curve and get a site that converts from Day 1, let us handle the heavy lifting.
