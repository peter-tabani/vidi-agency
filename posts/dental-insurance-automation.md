# The "Unpaid Work" Trap

Walk past your front desk right now. Is someone on hold?

In 2025, the average dental front desk spends **15 hours a week** on hold with insurance companies verifying eligibility. That is nearly two full days of lost productivity—"Unpaid Work" that generates zero revenue for the practice.

## The Denial Epidemic

Even worse, **80% of claim denials** this year are due to simple documentation errors that tired humans make.

When PPO reimbursements are flat and your supply costs are up 12%, you cannot afford to lose 30% of your revenue to "administrative accidents."

## The Fix: API Scraping & AI Claim Scrubbing

We don't just build websites; we build **Revenue Defense Systems**.

1.  **Automated Verification:** Our systems use APIs to "scrape" insurance databases in seconds. When a patient books, their benefits are verified *before* they walk in the door. No phone calls needed.
2.  **AI Claim Scrubbing:** Before a claim is sent, AI reviews it for errors. It spots the missing attachment or the wrong code instantly, reducing your denial rate by over 30%.

Stop letting insurance companies dictate your profitability. Automate the fight.
